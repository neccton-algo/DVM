# Diel vertical migration parameter estimation using acoustics backscatter data

This repository contains a generic recipe to estimate the upper and lower boundaries of sound scattering layer as a function of underwater PAR (photosythetically active radiation) to represent dial vertical migration of organisms (mesozooplankton in this example) to be coded in respective biogeochemical models.

The repository includes a jupyter notebook that:
